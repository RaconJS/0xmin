	code inside a virtual line acts like normal code with a few differences that affects the $ and @ phase;
	assembly inside virtual is not included in the final binary file. At the end of the virtual line, the cpu state is reset to how it was before the line;

code blocks;{
	a codeBlock is made using curly brackets;
	The global scope is similar to a inbuilt code block;
	e.g. { ...doStuff; } //
	It contains a list of assembly instructions for the assignment ('$') and assembly ('@') phases of compilation;
	when parsed in the metacode phase:
		It is turned into a list of numbers (aka 0 code), assembly code (aka @ code), functions (aka # code),and compiler code(aka $ code).
	Code blocks can be named. This can be useful for referenceing a block within itself, while keeping it self contained.
	e.g.
	{	
		{:block;
			{
				let block.b=2;
			};
			jump b;
		};
	};
	This naming syntax can also be useful for making loops
	e.g.
	{
		#def:{:blockName;//note that blocks are not assigned memory locations by default. 
			...doStuff;
			jump->blockName;//without the '#def' this would through an $error.
		};
	};
	Using named blocks without #def can be usefull for making multi-dimentional arrays. 
	e.g.
	{
		let matrix={
			{1;0;0};
			{0;1;0};
			{0;0;1}
		};
		let twoMatrixies={
			matrix;
			matrix
		};
	};
};
function blocks;{
	//function is made by a pair of normal brackets '()' followed by an optional function type =,=>,<=,<-,-> followed by curly brackets '{}'. the normal brackets contain a list of parameters.
	//All parameters and special function variables, like return and this, are stored in a scope inbetween the function instance and the parent scope of the function.
	//e.g.
		let Foo = #(a,b)={a;b};
		
		//Here we make a 'Foo' class. In this context the '=' symbol is what makes it a class.
		//It is not important here but this function returns an array with 2 items in it.
		//The '#' stops the compiler from doing 'Foo=()'.
		//We can also do:
	//e.g.
		let Foo(a,b)={a;b};
		//For more consise syntax; This 2nd example is slightly different than the first one in what it does.
	//e.g.
		let foo(a,b){a;b};

	//by default functions return the code block.
	//this can be changed by assigning a value to the inbuilt 'return' label.

	//note:
		#let a = #(){};
		//is exactly the same as
		#let a;#let a[0] = #(){};
	//When you call an object (aka a label), all the functions and objects inside the array part are called.
	//each function uses it's own parameters but they all share the same arguments, return value and function instance object.
	//e.g.
		let bar = {(a){a};(b,c){b;c}};
		def bar(1,2);
		//gives the same result as
		let bar = {(a,b){a;a;b}};
		bar(1,2);
		//gives the same result as
		let bar = {{{(a){a}}};(b,c){b;c}};
		def bar(1,2);
	
	//function variables
	#(){
		scope;//macro only
		return;
		arguments;//the list of arguments provided, as well as containing a namespace for the aguments.
		constructor;//is the original function;
		this;//same as this in javascript, except if the function is called without a parent (i.e. 'foo()' instead of 'bar.foo()') then then it returns the var scope where the function was origionally made.
		//If the function type is a class then this returns the new function instance.

			...doStuff;
		};
		#set: foo :: (){

	objectAssigning;{
		'{...}' and '(...)...{...}' operators
		You can assign the contense of a variable by adding an object or function expression after it.
		e.g.
		let foo(arg1,arg2)=>{...doStuff};
		let bar{...doStuff};
		At the moment they act exactly the same as the '::' operator.
		The only difference is that it cannot be done with the syntax '{}{}'. This allows for '{{}{}}' to be parsed as '{{};{}}'
	}
	brackets;{
		Can use: () {} [] aswell as #() #{} #[];
		The '#' (aka the meta) symbol can be put infront of a bracket in a long or short expression to distinguish it from function syntax
		e.g. a = (2+2) ;
		In line above we call the function 'a' as a class with the argument 4.
		e.g. a = #(2+2);
		In line above we assign 4 to the variable 'a'.
		In assembly scopes (@). the #(...) can be used to run meta code inbetween assembly lines.
		e.g. in tptasm: {
			r0 = #(4*3);//compiles to: mov r0 12
		}
	};
	{:operators;
		Â¬;{
			the Â¬ can be used in 2 ways depending on number of argumments.
			1:
				Â¬x turns a value into a label with the 'symbol' value-subtype.
				This can be used to make private variables that can only be accessed by curtain parts of the code
				{:intended use;
					e.g.
					let a;
					{
						let symbol;
						#a[Â¬symbol]=2;
						let a.returnSymbol(){
							#return = +a[Â¬symbol];
						}
					};
				};]
			2: In a long expresstion, if there are statements behind the Â¬, Â¬ will be interpretted as the collecter operator:
				This collecter operator gets the current long expression value makes it the start of a short expression.
				It is intended to be syntactic sugar for putting '()'s around a long expresstion
				e.g.
				a + b * c Â¬.d
				is the same as: ( (a + b * c).d )
				e.g.
				a + b * c Â¬()
				is the same as: ( (a + b * c)() )
		};

	proceedence{
		priorities{//from highest to lowest
			1: . //dot operator and function calls
			2: single argument operators including e.g. (+a) (-a) (*a) (/a) !a (Â¬a) (~a)
			3: :> <: //e.g. 'a:>foo()<:b' is evaluated in the order 'a,b,foo,foo(a,b)'
			4: all other operators including e.g. :: + - * / ...
			5: Â¬ // the 'a+b Â¬.c' operator
			6: = <=> <-> <- -> <= => //the last 4 are for in 0xmin assembly
		};
		except for assignment operators (=,<=>,<->) everything has the same priority.
		e.g. a+b*c is parsed as (a+b)*c
		assignment operators are always done last, and have the same priority
		e.g. a+b=c+d=e+f is parsed as  (a) = #(b = #(c))

compilation_settings;{
	These include the following:
		#"0xmin";
		#"tptasm";//made for the R216K computer.
		#"int";//basic number assembly language. no pointers or special assembly syntax except for "ram"
		#"table";//prints out a list of the output file, allong with the command name and source code. Is very usefull for debugging your machine code.
		#"len";
		#"code";//
		#"make file";//is true by default can use #"!make file"; if you just want to check that some code would compile.
	At the start of a '.0xmin' file you can add; all the compilation settings.
	You can put comments and white space before and between the compilation settings are fine.
	The compilation settings are parsed after the raw text file has been broken up into a syntax tree.
	This means that you can put white space, comments between the octothwarp '#', the string '""' and the semicolon ';'. Note that the semi-colon is mandatory.
	It is also parsed before the main code is.

	You can also put a "!" at the start of the string to negate the setting. e.g. #"!table"; will not print out a table
	This normally includes the assembly language and what data the compiler should print out when it is done.

	types;{
		':' operator;
		'foo : bar' operator would enforce the restriction 'bar' onto 'foo'; //similar to typescript
		where: foo is any Value and bar is a function or just a value;
		syntacticly: foo is a long expression and bar is a expression that matches up to a 'Â¬' or '='
		1+1:2+2 Â¬ = 2; compiles to: (((1+1) : (2+2)) Â¬) = 2;
		e.g.
		let label:condisions=2;//spl
		can make "type" objects
		e.g.
		let Int(){
			???//not sure how this would work yet
		};
		let foo:Int = 2;
		let bar:Int = "a";//throws error

		#let: foo(a,b,c){
			...doStuff;
		};
		#set: foo :: (){
			...doMoreStuff;
		} :: (){
			...doEvenMoreStuff;
		};
		This can already be done by adding an unnamed function or object at the end of a long expression,
		e.g. in 'foo(){...stuff}' '(){...stuff}' is the extension function, that adds onto the end of the 'foo' object.
		Currently '#obj{...}{...};' can be done to extend an object. This would be changed to '#obj{}::{};'

		the original documentation mentioned these 3;
		new is a type of $set;
		'var': marks a piece of code or assembly line as variable #(not constant);
		'const': marks a piece of code or assembly line as constant;
		'var' and 'const' add code onto a JS array of free code;
		'new': assigns memory locations;
		new searches through the avalable variableList or constantList and assigns the found memory location
