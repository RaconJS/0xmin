# 0xmin
worlds smallest 30bit computer in The Powder Toy.

TPT = ThePowderToy
comes with a compiler, emulator.cpp, the TPT computer itself

## to use
`./compiler.sh filename.0xmin outputName.filt`
or
`./compiler.sh filename.0xmin outputName.lua`
or
`./compiler.sh filename.0xmin` to send it to The Powder Toy

## requirements:{
the following are required for the full 0xmin experience.
### node.js v16
For the `compiler.js`. It uses "`a??b`" and "`a?.b`".
node.js v16 can be installed with the `installer.sh`
### ubuntu (strongly recommended)
Otherwise you will have to:
	change the file paths in `compile.sh` that point to The_powder_toy.
	translate the bash file: `compiler.sh` into another format.
### sublime-text3, from ubuntu store (optional)
For syntax highlighting for writing 0xmin code.
### the powder toy, form the ubuntu store 
instead of using the emulator.cpp, it gives you the actual visual computer.
